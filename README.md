Project background 
Malaysia is a growing country, and information communication and technology are playing vital roles in the country's growth. We define an e-store as the purchasing and selling of items or services using electronic systems such as the Internet and other computer networks. We have relatively few options for paying bills or trading online. Some innovative payment options in Malaysia, such as Paypal, RazerPay, and TNGeWallet, aim to transform the way e-commerce is conducted in the country. With the introduction of these services, many new start-ups will be able to easily offer their products and services online. 
These services have a lot of promise, and we hope they be successful and bring about a revolution in the Malaysian e-commerce industry. E-commerce is quickly becoming a well-accepted and widely used business concept. More and more commercial organisations are creating websites that allow them to conduct business transactions online. It is fair to argue that internet purchasing is growing more common. 
An online e-store is a virtual store on the internet where customers may explore the catalogues and pick products of interest. The things that have been picked and placed in a shopping cart will be displayed as an order. Simultaneously, further information will be required to complete the transaction. Typically, the consumer will be required to provide or pick a billing address, a mailing address, a shipping option, and payment information such as a credit card number. As soon as the order is placed, the customer receives an email notice.

Project Context
As Malaysia is developing more and more technology to ease the people’s problem, this project is to build a functional system for the customers to purchase products online of the Electronic Device Store. Electronic Device Store is a store where they manage sales manually such as picking up phone calls, emails, and fax for orders. While this project also eases the staffs’ burden daily, the desired result of the project is also to ensure the customer can prefer buying the store’s products online rather than using the traditional method. Convenience is the biggest factor for using this system because customers can purchase anything 24/7 without having any crowd lining up or bringing a heavy wallet out to pay. Customers also do not need to find parking especially in during weekends or festivals where the parking lots are full of cars. Moreover, customer can find deals and compare the prices online as there are also information and reviews shared by the other customers who has the first-hand experience of the purchase. Using the system, customer can also explore catalogues and pick their interested products to purchase using online payment options. When this solution is achieved, the outcome and quality of the store products sales can be more effective and efficient by the staffs. Thus, it saves the time of both parties.
